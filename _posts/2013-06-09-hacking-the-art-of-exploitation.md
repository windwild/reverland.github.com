This book's C part is very fascinating. Along with the author, you can actually achieve a set of note take and search tools for multiuser, and an interesting game. What's more, some linux/unix knowledge will be learned.

So I tried it.

To try these interesting things written in five years ago is not easy on my x86\_64 gentoo linux. There are tons of difference and I'm always confused by what I don't know. However, I was so happy with such interesting things after so much pains.

This book makes C fascinating to me! I'm so desired to be a C hacker!

Thanks to the author--Jon Erickson! Even too simple and fundamental, the book open the door to a interesting world for me.

## Experiment Notes on A 64-bit Machine

### Format for Pointer

pointer/address to be `%p` not `0x%08x`.

### Compile 32-bit Programs on a x86\_64 Machine

By default, gentoo linux amd64 will set `multilib` USE flag. You'll have a multilib glibc and gcc. Then to compile and link a program with gcc, just add `-m32` parameter to gcc.

{% highlight bash %}
gcc -m32 test.c
{% endhighlight %}

### Built-in Functions in Gcc

gcc actually have some functions built into it. It will use its built in version for some functions like `printf`. Even if you forget include header files, it will be compiled but give out a warning.

{% highlight bash %}
~/Work/project/hack ⮀ gcc -g -m32 -o firstprog firstprog.c
firstprog.c: In function ‘main’:
firstprog.c:7:5: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘printf’ [enabled by default]
{% endhighlight %}

### Disable SSP

To test hacking skills like stack overflow and so on on a modern x86\_64 machine. You have to cheat.To disable the stack smashing prevention(SSP) by gcc, you can simply specify a parameter `-fno-stack-protector`

{% highlight bash %}
gcc -fno-stack-protector test.c
{% endhighlight %}

### Disable Executable Space Protection

To let the stack be executable, you have two choice:

1. add `-z execstack` parameter to gcc when compiling.
2. Using `execstack` to set executable stack flag of ELF binaries and shared libraries

Both will work, It depend on you which to choose.

### Disable ASLR

If you check the book carefully later, you'll find some technics to prevent exploitation. One of them is ASLR.

To disable (Address space layout randomization)ASLR globally:

{% highlight python %}
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
{% endhighlight %}

Or just run the binary file using `setarch`.

Please refer to the References and `man setarch`.

### The virtual Memory

One of my observation is that if you run a 32-bit program on 64-bit system, the address in the memory will differ a lot from just 32-bit system.

According to my experience, the memory address ranges from about `0x804a014` to `0xffffdff8`, `.data` and `.bss` will locate at around `0x804axxx`. But the stack bottom will be at around `0xff7fcxxx`. What's important is that environment variables will be at the bottom of memory until `0xffffdff8`. `0xffffdff8` will be the `filename` of the execute file.

There are some other differences from the book. One of these is the length of file change 1, the address of environment variable for shellcode will change 1 byte.

I don't know why things like this, I'll try to find more about it and ask it at StackOverflow. But that's what I get after several tests, your machine may differ.

### About dtors section

I find I can't success on the exploitation about dtors. The destruction function address will be in `.fini_array` section. Note: objdump will show addresses in little endian. So address `0x08048473` will looks like that:

{% highlight bash %}
Contents of section .fini_array:
 8049ef8 73840408                             s... 
{% endhighlight %}

Furthermore, because of cpu's NX feature, when you try to modify `.dtors` or `fini_array` section, you'll just get a segfault.

### libnet-1.0 on amd64

Last thing I have to mentioned is that libnet-1.0 use too much `u_long`. `u_long` will take 8 bytes on a 64-bit machine but 4 bytes on a 32-bit one.

You have to care about that because it will build tcp header with incorrect length of source address and destination address.

I don't know how nemesis(which depends on libnet-1.0) works well on amd64 machines...

To compile and link with libnet-1.0 on gentoo amd64 architecture, try something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
gcc `libnet-1.0-config --defines` -o rst_hijack rst_hijack.c -lnet-1.0 -lpcap
{% endhighlight %}

### Enable IP Forward

When you want to try arp sproofing or arp poisoning, enable the ip forward for the kernel:

{% highlight bash %}
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
{% endhighlight %}


## Some Other Thoughts on This Book

Amazing！！When You first get a root shell in an exploitation, you can't stop jumping out of the chair! The book is simple and introductory, but both interesting and insight. I really like it.

## Hacker's Tools

> Man is most important, Google is the second.
> 
> Prof. Li Yinong

Consult to `man` if you are stuck, then search in google(NOT BAIDU).

- gcc to compile
- gdb to debug/attach, use as calculation and so on.
- objdump to be used as a disassembler to view executable in assembly form
- nm to list symbols in many kinds of files
- perl for one line exploitation
- python for one line exploitation
- hexdump to dump binary files into hex
- shell to facilitate with exploitation.
- many unix tools like od/sed/awk/bc and so on may be useful.

About net hack, You may like to use:

- libnet to inject packets
- libpcap to capture packets
- tcpdump to capture and show packets
- dsniff to sniff the net and arp poison
- netcat, wow, swiss knife
- telnet, a good client to use
- ettercap/nessus/metasploit and so on.
